# Vite Starter Node Typescript

This is a simple starter template for a Node.js project using the Vite bundler and watch mode.
It will automatically run your built files when in watch mode.

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm dlx degit https://github.com/FalkZ/vite-starter-node-ts my-project
pnpm install
# runs project in watch mode
pnpm dev
# builds project
pnpm build
```
